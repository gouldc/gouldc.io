	"abstract": "We investigate the effect of teenage driving on mortality and risky behaviors in the United States using a regression discontinuity design. We estimate that motor vehicle fatalities rise by 40% at the minimum legal driving age cutoff, implying a mortality risk per additional mile driven 6-9 times higher than the risk faced by adult drivers. We also find a stark 80% increase in female deaths from drug overdoses and carbon monoxide poisoning at the cutoff, caused by changes in both suicides and accidental deaths. Our analysis suggests driving regulations could be an effective tool to improve teenage health.",

	"abstract": "We develop a new framework for valuing health and longevity improvements that departs from
conventional but unrealistic assumptions of full annuitization and deterministic health. Our framework
can value the prevention of mortality and of illness, and it can quantify the effects of retirement policies
on the value of life. We apply the framework to life-cycle data and generate new insights absent from the
conventional approach. First, treatment is up to five times more valuable than prevention, even when both
extend life equally. This asymmetry helps explain low observed investment in preventive care. Second,
severe illness can significantly increase the value of statistical life, helping to reconcile theory with
empirical findings that consumers value life-extension more in bleaker health states. Third, retirement
annuities boost aggregate demand for life-extension. We calculate that Social Security adds $10.6 trillion
(11 percent) to the value of post-1940 longevity gains and would add $127 billion to the value of a one
percent decline in future mortality."
